Genetic Algorithm â€“ Windows Forms Application

This repository contains a Genetic Algorithm (GA) implementation developed entirely in C# without using any external GA libraries. The project is a Windows Forms App that allows the user to configure all key parameters via the interface, solves a predefined minimization problem, and displays the convergence graph along with the best solution.
